# i.	Use the reduced model to predict the average sales for companies who spend $50,000 in advertising and $25,000 in bonus. Find the 95% confidence interval for your prediction.
# j.	Use the reduced model to predict the sales for a company who spend $50,000 in advertising and $25,000 in bonus. Find the 95% prediction interval for your prediction.



# 2.	A company that provides transportation services uses a telemarketing 
# division to help sell its services. The division manager is interested 
# in the time spent on the phone by the telemarketers in the division. 
# Data on the number of months of employment and the number of calls paced 
#per day (an average for 20 working days) is recorded for 20 employees. 
#The data are in the file: TELEMARK5.csv
# a.	Look at the scatter plot of the data. Put the least-square line on the scatter plot. Whatâ€™s the R2 of the regression that describes the relationship between CALLS and MONTHS? Get the residual plot for the regression that describes the relationship between CALLS and MONTHS.
# b.	Get the relationship that describes the CALLS and MONTH. (polynomial)
# c.	Test whether the second order is significant or not at 5% level of significance.
# d.	Analyze the residual plot for your new model.
